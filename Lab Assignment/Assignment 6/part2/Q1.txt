a) S7-static-call-stack.s use call stack, use the register r5 the top of the call stack, but S7-static-call-reg.s does not.

b) The approach followed in stack has advantage when the code has nested function calls(the first callee calls another function).

c) The approach followed in reg has advantage when the code has only one callee.
